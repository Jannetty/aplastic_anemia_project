In previous studies, survival after transplantation improved from 48\% (in the 1976-1980 cohort) to 66\% (in the 1988-1992 cohort),4 and more recently from 61\% to 76\% in patients grafted before 1999 or between 1999 and 200910: the latter study included both sibling ({SIB}) and unrelated donor ({UD}) grafts as well as children and adults. Improved outcome may have been the consequence of changes in graft-versus-host disease ({GvHD}) prophylaxis,4 as well as changes in the conditioning regimens,11-15 better donor selection, and a larger use of antithymocyte globulin ({ATG}).2,16 Nevertheless, for patients older than the age of 40, transplant-related mortality continued to be on the order of 50\% in the 1999 to 2009 period. In more recent years, supportive care has further improved and may have reduced the risk of transplant-related complications.},

We hypothesized that the humanized anti-{CD}52 {mAb} alemtuzumab might be active in {SAA} because of its lymphocytotoxic properties. We investigated alemtuzumab monotherapy from 2003-2010 in treatment-naive, relapsed, and refractory {SAA} in 3 separate research protocols at the National Institutes of Health. Primary outcome was hematologic response at 6 months. For refractory disease, patients were randomized between rabbit {ATG} + cyclosporine (n = 27) and alemtuzumab (n = 27); the response rate for alemtuzumab was 37\% (95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 18\%-57\%) and for rabbit {ATG} 33\% (95\% {CI}, 14\%-52\%; P = .78). The 3-year survival was 83\% (95\% {CI}, 68\%-99\%) for alemtuzumab and 60\% (95\% {CI}, 43\%-85\%) for rabbit {ATG} (P = .16). For relapsed disease (n = 25), alemtuzumab was administered in a single-arm study; the response rate was 56\% (95\% {CI}, 35\%-77\%) and the 3-year survival was 86\% (95\% {CI}, 72\%-100\%). In treatment-naive patients (n = 16), alemtuzumab was compared with horse and rabbit {ATG} in a 3-arm randomized study; the response rate was 19\% (95\% {CI} 0\%-40\%), and the alemtuzumab arm was discontinued early. We conclude that alemtuzumab is effective in {SAA}, but best results are obtained in the relapsed and refractory settings.

, 

, Aplastic anemia ({AA}) is a T cell–mediated autoimmune disorder of the hematopoietic system manifested by severe depletion of the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells ({HSPCs}). Nonetheless, our understanding of the complex relationship between {HSPCs} and T cells is still obscure, mainly limited by techniques and the sparsity of {HSPCs} in the context of bone marrow failure. Here we performed single-cell transcriptome analysis of residual {HSPCs} and T cells to identify the molecular players from patients with {AA}. We observed that residual {HSPCs} in {AA} exhibited lineage-specific alterations in gene expression and transcriptional regulatory networks, indicating a selective disruption of distinct lineage-committed progenitor pools. In particular, {HSPCs} displayed frequently altered alternative splicing events and skewed patterns of polyadenylation in transcripts related to {DNA} damage and repair, suggesting a likely role in {AA} progression to myelodysplastic syndromes. We further identified cell type–specific ligand-receptor interactions as potential mediators for ongoing {HSPCs} destruction by T cells. By tracking patients after immunosuppressive therapy ({IST}), we showed that hematopoiesis remission was incomplete accompanied by {IST} insensitive interactions between {HSPCs} and T cells as well as sustained abnormal transcription state. These data collectively constitute the transcriptomic landscape of disrupted hematopoiesis in {AA} at single-cell resolution, providing new insights into the molecular interactions of engaged T cells with residual {HSPCs} and render novel therapeutic opportunities for {AA}.},

	abstract = {Aplastic anemia ({AA}) is an autoimmune disease characterized by peripheral blood pancytopenia and bone marrow failure. Recently, a research study verified bone marrow failure of {AA} patients resulting from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell ({HSPC}) attack by active T cells. Nonetheless, whether B cells, as one of the important immune cells, destruct the hematopoiesis is still unclear. Here, a large-scale single-cell transcriptomic sequencing of 20,000 bone marrow cells from {AA} patients and healthy donors was performed. A total of 17 clusters and differentially expressed genes were identified in each cluster relative to other clusters, which were considered potential marker genes in each cluster. The top differentially expressed genes in {HSPCs} (S100A8, {RETN}, and {TNFAIP}3), monocytes ({CXCL}8, {JUN}, and {IL}1B), and neutrophils and granulocytes ({CXCL}8, {NFKBIA}, and {MT}-{CYB}) were related to immune and inflammatory injury. Then, the B-cell receptor ({BCR}) diversities and pairing frequencies of V and J genes were analyzed. The highest pairing frequencies in {AA} patients were {IGHV}3-20-{IGKJ}2, {IGHV}3-20-{IGKJ}4, and {IGHV}3-20-{IGHLJ}2. Meanwhile, there were 3 V genes, including {IGHV}3-7, {IGHV}3-33, and {IGLV}2-11, with elevated expression in B cells from {AA} patients. Cell type–specific ligand–receptor was further identified in B-cell interaction with hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. The changed ligand–receptor pairs involved antigen presentation, inflammation, apoptosis, and proliferation of B cells. These data showed the transcriptomic landscape of hematopoiesis in {AA} at single-cell resolution, providing new insights into hematopoiesis failure related with aberrance of B cells, and provide available targets of treatment for {AA}.},

	abstract = {Aplastic anemia ({AA}) is characterized by bone marrow ({BM}) hypocellularity, resulting in peripheral cytopenias. An antigen-driven and likely auto-immune dysregulated T-cell homeostasis results in hematopoietic stem cell injury, which ultimately leads to the pathogenesis of the acquired form of this disease. Auto-immune and inflammatory processes further influence the disease course as well as response rate to therapy, mainly consisting of intensive immunosuppressive therapy and allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Bone marrow hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells are strongly regulated by the crosstalk with the surrounding microenvironment and its components like mesenchymal stromal cells, also consistently altered in {AA}. Whether latter is a contributing cause or rather consequence of the disease remains an open question. Overall, niche disruption may contribute to disease progression, sustain pancytopenia and promote clonal evolution. Here we review the existing knowledge on {BM} microenvironmental changes in acquired {AA} and discuss their relevance for the pathogenesis and therapy.},

We present a robust statistical model, scvis, to capture and visualize the low-dimensional structures in single-cell gene expression data. Simulation results demonstrate that low-dimensional representations learned by scvis preserve both the local and global neighbor structures in the data. In addition, scvis is robust to the number of data points and learns a probabilistic parametric mapping function to add new data points to an existing embedding. We then use scvis to analyze four single-cell {RNA}-sequencing datasets, exemplifying interpretable two-dimensional representations of the high-dimensional single-cell {RNA}-sequencing data.},

It is an important step for studying cell sub-populations and lineages, with an effective low-dimensional representation and visualization of the original {scRNA}-Seq data. At the single cell level, the transcriptional fluctuations are much larger than the average of a cell population, and the low amount of {RNA} transcripts will increase the rate of technical dropout events. Therefore, {scRNA}-seq data are much noisier than traditional bulk {RNA}-seq data. In this study, we proposed the deep variational autoencoder for {scRNA}-seq data ({VASC}), a deep multi-layer generative model, for the unsupervised dimension reduction and visualization of {scRNA}-seq data. {VASC} can explicitly model the dropout events and find the nonlinear hierarchical feature representations of the original data. Tested on over 20 datasets, {VASC} shows superior performances in most cases and exhibits broader dataset compatibility compared to four state-of-the-art dimension reduction and visualization methods. In addition, {VASC} provides better representations for very rare cell populations in the 2D visualization. As a case study, {VASC} successfully re-establishes the cell dynamics in pre-implantation embryos and identifies several candidate marker genes associated with early embryo development. Moreover, {VASC} also performs well on a 10× Genomics dataset with more cells and higher dropout rate.},

	abstract = {Single-cell {RNA} sequencing ({scRNA}-seq) has enabled researchers to study gene expression at a cellular resolution. However, noise due to amplification and dropout may obstruct analyses, so scalable denoising methods for increasingly large but sparse {scRNA}-seq data are needed. We propose a deep count autoencoder network ({DCA}) to denoise {scRNA}-seq datasets. {DCA} takes the count distribution, overdispersion and sparsity of the data into account using a negative binomial noise model with or without zero-inflation, and nonlinear gene-gene dependencies are captured. Our method scales linearly with the number of cells and can, therefore, be applied to datasets of millions of cells. We demonstrate that {DCA} denoising improves a diverse set of typical {scRNA}-seq data analyses using simulated and real datasets. {DCA} outperforms existing methods for data imputation in quality and speed, enhancing biological discovery.},

	abstract = {Myeloblast expansion is a hallmark of disease progression and comprises {CD}34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells ({HSPC}). How this compartment evolves during disease progression in chronic myeloid neoplasms is unknown. Using single-cell {RNA} sequencing and high-parameter flow cytometry, we show that chronic myelomonocytic leukemia ({CMML}) {CD}34+ {HSPC} can be classified into three differentiation trajectories: monocytic, megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor ({MEP}), and normal-like. Hallmarks of monocytic-biased trajectory were enrichment of {CD}120b+ inflammatory granulocyte–macrophage progenitor ({GMP})-like cells, activated cytokine receptor signaling, phenotypic hematopoietic stem cell ({HSC}) depletion, and adverse outcomes. Cytokine receptor diversity was generally an adverse feature and elevated in {CD}120b+ {GMPs}. Hypomethylating agents decreased monocytic-biased cells in {CMML} patients. Given the enrichment of {RAS} pathway mutations in monocytic-biased cells, {NRAS}-competitive transplants and {LPS}-treated xenograft models recapitulated monocytic-biased {CMML}, suggesting that hematopoietic stress precipitates the monocytic-biased state. Deconvolution of {HSPC} compartments in other myeloid neoplasms and identifying therapeutic strategies to mitigate the monocytic-biased differentiation trajectory should be explored.Our findings establish that multiple differentiation states underlie {CMML} disease progression. These states are negatively augmented by inflammation and positively affected by hypomethylating agents. Furthermore, we identify {HSC} depletion and expansion of {GMP}-like cells with increased cytokine receptor diversity as a feature of myeloblast expansion in inflammatory chronic myeloid neoplasms.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 476},

	abstract = {Two fundamental aims that emerge when analyzing single-cell {RNA}-seq data are identifying which genes vary in an informative manner and determining how these genes organize into modules. Here, we propose a general approach to these problems, called ‘‘Hotspot,’’ that operates directly on a given metric of cellcell similarity, allowing for its integration with any method (linear or non-linear) for identifying the primary axes of transcriptional variation between cells. In addition, we show that when using multimodal data, Hotspot can be used to identify genes whose expression reﬂects alternative notions of similarity between cells, such as physical proximity in a tissue or clonal relatedness in a cell lineage tree. In this manner, we demonstrate that while Hotspot is capable of identifying genes that reﬂect nuanced transcriptional variability between T helper cells, it can also identify spatially dependent patterns of gene expression in the cerebellum as well as developmentally heritable expression programs during embryogenesis. Hotspot is implemented as an open-source Python package and is available for use at http://www.github.com/yoseﬂab/hotspot.

However, there is a lack of methods to assess the contributions of biological pathways and transcription factors to an overall developmental trajectory mapped from {scRNAseq} data. In this manuscript, we present a simplified approach for trajectory inference of pathway significance ({TIPS}) that leverages existing knowledgebases of functional pathways and other gene lists to provide further mechanistic insights into a biological process. {TIPS} identifies key pathways which contribute to a process of interest, as well as the individual genes that best reflect these changes. {TIPS} also provides insight into the relative timing of pathway changes, as well as a suite of visualizations to enable simplified data interpretation of {scRNAseq} libraries generated using a wide range of techniques. The {TIPS} package can be run through either a web server or downloaded as a user-friendly {GUI} run in R, and may serve as a useful tool to help biologists perform deeper functional analyses and visualization of their single-cell data.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Repeated cross-sectional time series single cell data confound several sources of variation, with contributions from measurement noise, stochastic cell-to-cell variation and cell progression at different rates. Time series from single cell assays are particularly susceptible to confounding as the measurements are not averaged over populations of cells. When several genes are assayed in parallel these effects can be estimated and corrected for under certain smoothness assumptions on cell progression. , Results: We present a principled probabilistic model with a Bayesian inference scheme to analyse such data. We demonstrate our method’s utility on public microarray, {nCounter} and {RNA}-seq datasets from three organisms. Our method almost perfectly recovers withheld capture times in an Arabidopsis dataset, it accurately estimates cell cycle peak times in a human prostate cancer cell line and it correctly identifies two precocious cells in a study of paracrine signalling in mouse dendritic cells. Furthermore, our method compares favourably with Monocle, a state-of-the-art technique. We also show using held-out data that uncertainty in the temporal dimension is a common confounder and should be accounted for in analyses of repeated cross-sectional time series., Availability and Implementation: Our method is available on {CRAN} in the {DeLorean} package., Contact:

	abstract = {The development of single-cell {RNA} sequencing ({scRNA}-seq) has allowed high-resolution analysis of cell-type diversity and transcriptional networks controlling cell-fate specification. To identify the transcriptional networks governing human retinal development, we performed {scRNA}-seq analysis on 16 time points from developing retina as well as four early stages of retinal organoid differentiation. We identified evolutionarily conserved patterns of gene expression during retinal progenitor maturation and specification of all seven major retinal cell types. Furthermore, we identified gene-expression differences between developing macula and periphery and between distinct populations of horizontal cells. We also identified species-specific patterns of gene expression during human and mouse retinal development. Finally, we identified an unexpected role for {ATOH}7 expression in regulation of photoreceptor specification during late retinogenesis. These results provide a roadmap to future studies of human retinal development and may help guide the design of cell-based therapies for treating retinal dystrophies., Lu et al. performed {scRNA}-seq on the developing human retina and retinal organoids. Using comprehensive analyses, they deduced mechanisms regulating human retinal cell-fate specification and foveagenesis and contrasted these with murine retinal development.
