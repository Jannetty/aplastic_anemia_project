	abstract = {{TO} {THE} {EDITOR}:Age is known to be a strong negative predictor of survival in patients undergoing an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ({HSCT}) for severe acquired aplastic anemia ({SAA}), with higher mortality in patients \&gt;40 years of age,1 and this has been confirmed in several large studies.2-7SAA can also be treated with immunosuppressive therapy ({IST}), with a lower risk of early complications, and first-line {IST} and bone marrow transplant have been compared in different age groups.5 Currently, the international guidelines recommend {IST} first line, older than the age of 408 or 50.9 The question is: are these age cutoff values still valid today? In previous studies, survival after transplantation improved from 48\% (in the 1976-1980 cohort) to 66\% (in the 1988-1992 cohort),4 and more recently from 61\% to 76\% in patients grafted before 1999 or between 1999 and 200910: the latter study included both sibling ({SIB}) and unrelated donor ({UD}) grafts as well as children and adults. Improved outcome may have been the consequence of changes in graft-versus-host disease ({GvHD}) prophylaxis,4 as well as changes in the conditioning regimens,11-15 better donor selection, and a larger use of antithymocyte globulin ({ATG}).2,16 Nevertheless, for patients older than the age of 40, transplant-related mortality continued to be on the order of 50\% in the 1999 to 2009 period. In more recent years, supportive care has further improved and may have reduced the risk of transplant-related complications.},
